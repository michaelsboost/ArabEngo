# ArabEngo
Learn Arabic for English Speakers with ArabEngo!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikethedj4/ArabEngo/gh-pages/chat-typing.png)

We all learned our first language through social interaction and communication. Sites like [Verbling](https://www.verbling.com/community) and [Speaky](https://www.speaky.com/) are great sites that take advantage of using this technique and we highly recommend them!

However what if you don't want to have a conversation with a real person? What if you just want to text message a robot and learn the language that way? That's why we created ArabEngo!

* [Uikit](https://getuikit.com) - Used mostly for the website's interface and part of the lessons's interface
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - duh
* [Github Gists](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/) - A reliable host used to save your weave to the cloud
* [Twitter Web API](https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines) - Allows users to interact with ArabEngo developers easier and share their chats to the ArabEngo community.
