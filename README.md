# ArabEngo
Learn Arabic for English Speakers with ArabEngo!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikethedj4/ArabEngo/gh-pages/arabengo_app.png)

We all learned our first language through social interaction and communication. Sites like [Verbling](https://www.verbling.com/community) and [Speaky](https://www.speaky.com/) are great sites that take advantage of using this technique and we highly recommend them!

However what if you don't want to have a conversation with a real person? What if you just want to text message a robot and learn the language that way? That's why we created ArabEngo!

Tech
-------------

ArabEngo uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Poly UI Kit](https://github.com/Guilh/Poly) - Used for lessons & alphabet's user interface 
* [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) - Used to make the lesson designer
* [Uikit](https://getuikit.com) - Used briefly throughout the website, skills and chat section
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - duh
* [ResponsiveVoice.JS](https://responsivevoice.org/) - Used to convert text to speech. Also main reason why this application is under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0](https://github.com/mikethedj4/ArabEngo/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.md) license and not the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.
* [Github Gists](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/) - A reliable host used to save your lessons & chats to the cloud
* [Twitter Web API](https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines) - Allows users to share their lessons and chats to the community but also makes it easier interact with ArabEngo developers.
